# Family Recipes Box

## Title : Family Recipes Box 

Description : This app is for preserving all family traditional and favorite recipes. Parents or grandparents or family can later use it to share to their kids. It is very common for most youngsters to miss home made food.  At some point in our early days out of home, we tend to call up and ask for recipes and parents are worried about their kids eating healthy food. 
This app could be useful to everyone :)
