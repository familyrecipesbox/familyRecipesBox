# Family Recipes Box

This app is for preserving all family traditional and favorite recipes. Parents or grandparents or family members can later use it to share to their kids. It is very common for most youngsters to miss home made food.  At some point in our early days out of home, we tend to call up and ask for recipes and parents are worried about their kids eating healthy food. 
Anyone can use this app in 3 simple steps :
* Capture - Take pictures, videos and notes while cooking your favorite recipes.
* Save - Add to your family recipes box.
* Share - Share with your family and friends :)
